# Changelog

Notable changes of P4K-Extractor, one section per Release. The section of a version becomes the
notes of its GitHub Release; the workspace version names the next Release, and `cargo xtask`
fails while its section is missing.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `p4kx texture info` and `p4kx texture merge`: read a DDS texture split into a header and mip
  parts, from an Archive or from files on disk, and merge it into one standard DDS file.
- `p4kx cryxml`: convert a CryXml file on disk (`CryXmlB`, `CryXml`, `CRY3SDK`, either byte
  order) to well-formed UTF-8 XML; text XML is written unchanged.

## [0.1.0]

The first Release: open, browse and extract Star Citizen Archives.

### Added

- Reading Archive layouts v1 and v2: ZIP64 central directory, Store, Deflate and Zstandard
  Entries, AES-128-CBC encrypted Entries.
- Detection of the installed Channels and the Build of each, plus manually added folders and
  Archives.
- The `p4kx` command line: `list`, `search` and `extract` with JSON output and documented exit
  codes.
- The P4K-Extractor window: Channel picker, drag and drop, recent Archives, path tree, sortable
  Entry table, search with quick-filter chips, text and hex preview, and Extraction of selected,
  shown or all Entries with progress, cancellation and conflict policies.
- A notice with a reload offer when the open Archive changes on disk.
- German and British English interface, KRT look.
- A portable ZIP and a per-user MSI installer.
- An optional check for a newer Release at start, off by default and switchable in the Help menu.
