//! The animations of a creature Entity. Its `SAnimatedCharacterComponentParams` name a Mannequin
//! animation database (`.adb`), whose fragments list the clips by name; the parameter file
//! (`.chrparams`) of its skeleton names the folder, and possibly a track database, the clips are
//! stored in. [`creature_animations`] reads the clips, [`Assembly::animate`] fits them to the
//! skeleton and [`Assembly::write_glb_animated_with`] writes them.
