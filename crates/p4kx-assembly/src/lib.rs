//! Assembly service of P4KX: resolves the Loadout tree of an Entity and reads the CHF
//! files of Characters.
//!
//! [`Entities`] finds an Entity by record path, GUID or class name. [`LoadoutResolver`] resolves
//! its default Loadout (`SEntityComponentDefaultLoadoutParams`) into an [`EntityNode`] tree: every
//! port with the Entity attached to it, the port's definition (`SItemPortDef`: sizes, types and
//! transform), and recursively the ports of each attached Entity. A Loadout entry's own Loadout
//! overrides the attached Entity's default Loadout per port; ports a Loadout does not name fall
//! back to the port definition's default item. XML Loadouts are read through [`LoadoutFiles`],
//! e.g. [`ArchiveFiles`].
//!
//! A port that cannot be resolved, such as a dangling Reference, an unknown class name or a
//! cycle, is kept in the tree as [`Attachment::Unresolved`] with a [`LoadoutError`]; the rest of
//! the Loadout still resolves.
//!
//! [`EntityCatalogue`] lists every Entity once, with its [`EntityKind`] and [`ItemFacts`], for
//! pickers; [`EntityCatalogue::compatible`] narrows it to what a port takes.
//!
//! [`LoadoutResolver::resolve_with`] applies [`LoadoutChanges`] while it resolves: ports left out
//! and Entities attached instead, each checked against the port's [`PortConstraints`] with the
//! [`ItemFacts`] of the Entity, reported as [`ChangeError`]s.
//!
//! [`Assembly::build`] turns the tree into a scene graph of placed models: the geometry each
//! Entity's Record names ([`Geometry`]), read through a [`ModelProvider`] such as
//! [`ArchiveModels`], placed at its port's helper in the parent's model, with the material
//! library the Entity chooses; [`Assembly::write_glb`] exports it as one GLB with a node per part
//! named `<port>/<entity>`. Parts that cannot be resolved are listed as [`Issue`]s.
//! [`Assembly::build_with_palettes`] also resolves the tint palette of each part
//! ([`ForgePalettes`] reads the `TintPaletteTree` Records), which the GLB draws the materials with
//! that take one; [`Assembly::write_glb_with`] embeds the textures of the materials.
//!
//! An Entity whose Record names a vehicle implementation (`VehicleComponentParams`) gets it with
//! the Modification it selects applied, as [`EntityNode::vehicle`]: the parts with their item
//! ports, treads and wheels, and per port the [`PortVisibility`] that [`PortNode::visibility`]
//! shows.
//!
//! [`PrefabSet`] reads the prefab libraries below `Data\Prefabs` and [`PrefabSet::resolve`] turns
//! a prefab into its [`ResolvedObject`]s with transforms to the prefab's space, every nested prefab
//! expanded in place with the parent's rotation applied. Cycles, depth and size are bounded; what
//! cannot be expanded is listed as [`PrefabIssue`]s.
//!
//! [`audio`] indexes the audio of an Archive once: the ATL definitions that map audio trigger
//! names to Wwise events and the soundbanks whose `HIRC` sections hold those events, matched by
//! the events' Wwise short IDs ([`audio::wwise_id`]). [`audio::AudioIndex::entity_audio`] lists
//! the audio triggers an Entity names with their events and soundbanks.
//!
//! [`character`] reads and writes the CHF files of Characters and their JSON form.
//!
//! [`Armour::build`] puts [`Piece`]s of armour and clothing on the default body of a
//! [`BodyVariant`]: the variant's skeleton and default body skin, constant paths, and per piece
//! the geometry its Record names for the variant's tag ([`Wearable`]), skinned to the body's
//! skeleton by bone name; [`Armour::write_glb`] exports it as one skinned GLB. A piece that cannot
//! be fitted is an [`Issue`]. [`LoadoutResolver::worn`] takes the pieces from a resolved Loadout
//! tree, and [`Piece::layer`] puts pieces given by hand on top of them.
//!
//! [`Head::from_character`] makes the head of a CHF [`character::Character`]: the head skin of its
//! rig, shaped by the Character's face DNA ([`Piece::shaped`]) and worn on the body of the rig's
//! variant. [`Head::dressed`] adds the teeth and the items of the Character's head port (eyes,
//! hair, brows, lashes, beard), read through [`HeadItems`] such as [`ForgeItems`], with the
//! material choices of the Character ([`Look`]); [`Armour::write_glb_with`] embeds the textures.
//! [`Head::with_expressions`] adds the head's expression blendshapes as morph targets.
