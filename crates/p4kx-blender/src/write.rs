/// each part applied; the textures of their materials are written as they are in the Archive, at
/// the mip level `options.texture_mip`, not baked into the meshes. The material descriptions list
/// every texture slot, layer, palette entry and shader parameter of the materials the meshes are
/// drawn with; `models` supplies the layer materials their layers name. The level of detail, the mip
/// level and the vertex colours are those of `options`; `options.materials` is ignored. The
/// Interior of `assembly`, if it has one, is written below an `Interior` node of the root: its
/// containers, models, props and lights are nodes of the kinds `container`, `object` and `light`.
///
/// Everything is written into a temporary folder next to `out`, which replaces `out` once the
/// package is complete. `out` must not exist, or be an empty folder, or hold a package an earlier
/// run wrote; an earlier package stays when the new one fails. `cancelled` is polled between the
/// files and stops the run with [`PackageError::Cancelled`].
///
/// A texture that cannot be loaded does not fail the package: its materials keep their plain
/// colours and the manifest lists it among the issues.
