//! Export service of P4KX: the Record export and the Basetool catalog (ADR-0002).
//!
//! [`write_record_export`] writes a selection of Records in a [`RecordForm`]: one Record XML or
//! Record JSON file per Record under its record path (ADR-0008), or one NDJSON file with one
//! Record per line in record-path order, and returns a [`RecordExportSummary`]. Record JSON is
//! defined in `docs/record-json.md` and `schemas/record-json.schema.json`.
//!
//! [`build_catalog`] reads the DataForge of an open Archive, selects the Records of every kind by
//! record-path prefix and type in parallel, leaves out development leftovers, resolves names and
//! descriptions in English and German from the Archive's `global.ini` files, takes the blueprints
//! with all tiers, the quality, pool, reward-source and dismantle Records from [`read_crafting`],
//! reads each item's
//! [`ItemClass`] from its English description, classifies every ship and item as a
//! [`Playability`] and writes the
//! catalog as deterministic UTF-8 JSON. A selected Record that cannot be read is left out and
//! reported as a [`CatalogFailure`] in the [`CatalogSummary`]. [`catalog_schema`] returns its JSON Schema, generated from
//! the same types (`docs/basetool-catalog.md`).
//!
//! The starmap objects of the catalog take their world positions from the system containers
//! (`ObjectContainers/PU/system`): the position of every `Child` element is composed with the
//! positions and rotations of the Children above it ([`StarmapSummary`] counts the result).
//!
//! The harvestable locations of the catalog are the system containers whose `.soc` names a
//! provider preset, each with the starmap object it hangs below in that walk (ADR-0236).
//!
//! The shops of the catalog are the `ShopBackup` entries of the registry
//! `Data\Libs\CosmoTools\LayerRecovery\LayerBackups.xml`, with kind and brand from the shop
//! containers and a link to the starmap object of their location ([`ShopSummary`] counts the
//! result, ADR-0069) and the item GUIDs of the inventory file their containers name (ADR-0071).
//!
//! [`build_ship_base`] reads the base data of every ship: hull mass and hit points from the
//! vehicle implementation, cargo capacity from the cargo grids of the default Loadout, size and
//! the Loadout itself, each value with its source file and field (`docs/ship-base-data.md`);
//! [`ShipReader`] reads one ship.
//!
//! [`read_variant_groups`] finds the variant groups of the ships and items (ADR-0066) with the
//! rule of the catalog's `variantOf` and without building a catalog, for a front-end that folds
//! variants under their base.
//!
//! [`TagTree::build`] reads the tag tree of a [`DataForge`]: tag GUID to tag path, parent and
//! children, at most [`MAX_TAG_DEPTH`] levels deep. [`TagTree::find_path`] finds the tags with a
//! tag path. The catalog kinds that match tags (paints, loadouts) use the tree, and
//! `RecordExportOptions::tags` adds the tag path to every tag Reference of an exported Record.
//!
//! [`read_crafting`] reads the complete crafting data of a DataForge as [`Crafting`]: every tier
//! of every blueprint with its selections ("choose n"), quantity multipliers and
//! quality modifiers, the quality distributions with their location overrides, the quality
//! quantizations with the `ResourceType`s that use them, the blueprint
//! pools with the contracts that reward them, the dismantle processes and the global
//! parameters. It is the library API the catalog's crafting fields are built on.
//!
//! [`read_action_maps`] reads the action maps of the default profile
//! (`Data\Libs\Config\defaultProfile.xml`): every action with the localisation key of its label
//! and its default bindings per [`Device`]; [`write_action_maps`] writes them with the labels in
//! one language as JSON or CSV.
//!
//! [`write_localization_table`] writes every localisation key of a [`TextSet`] with its texts in
//! the chosen languages as JSON or CSV.
