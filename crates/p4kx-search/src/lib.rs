//! Content search service of P4KX: text inside Records, localisation and Entries
//! (ADR-0044).
//!
//! A search is a parallel scan on demand, with no index kept anywhere. [`search_records`] reads
//! the canonical tree of every Record and matches its string, localisation key and enum values;
//! [`search_localization`] matches the texts of each language's `global.ini`; [`search_entries`]
//! matches the lines of text and `CryXml` Entries. [`search`] runs the sources a
//! [`SearchOptions`] names over an Archive. Matching is a case-insensitive substring match of a
//! [`Needle`].
//!
//! Every source visits its items in a fixed order and appends the results of parallel tasks in
//! that order, so the hits do not depend on the number of threads. A source reports at most
//! [`SearchOptions::limit`] hits and says whether more exist, polls a stop function and holds a
//! bounded amount of memory: plain text is streamed, `CryXml` and UTF-16 Entries are read whole
//! under a memory budget, and one language's `global.ini` is held at a time. Text in a hit is an
//! [`Excerpt`] that is safe to print.
