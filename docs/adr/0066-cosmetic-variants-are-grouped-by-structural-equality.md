# Cosmetic variants are grouped by structural equality

Decided for issue #325. Builds on ADR-0054 (the catalog grows additively), ADR-0050 (the vehicle
implementation is patched by the Modification) and ADR-0065 (item stat blocks).

The Basetool matches hangar ships by class name and collapses variants when it creates ships and
items from the catalog. Grouping ships by `vehicleDefinition` alone both over-merges (separately
sold ships such as the Cutlass Black and Steel share one definition) and under-merges (the same
ship under two definitions).

## Decision

- **`variantOf` on `ships` and `items`.** The GUID of the group's base, `null` for the base and for
  an entity alone in its group. Every value resolves to an entry of the same kind. Version 1 stays
  open and additive.
- **Cosmetic means structurally equal without the loadout.** Ships: equal `vehicleDefinition`,
  equal vehicle implementation after the Modification, compared as the whole patched `Vehicle`
  element tree (so `Elem` overrides of any element count). Ship Records carry no armour component
  on LIVE, so armour is not part of the rule. The default loadout does not count, so editions
  that differ only in it are grouped; materials and names never count. The item ports that take
  paints are part of the implementation, so a Modification that changes only the paints a ship
  accepts starts its own group. Items: equal `AttachDef` type, subtype, size, grade and
  manufacturer, equal stat blocks including `resourceStates`, and equal components (the default
  loadout of an item included), leaving out four per-item interaction components and a few named
  fields (`Tags`, the material and palette of the geometry, two inventory interaction fields). The
  3D model stays compared: a different model is not cosmetic, and without it unrelated props
  collapsed into groups of hundreds on LIVE. The exact lists, taken from the field differences
  between colour siblings on LIVE, are in `docs/basetool-catalog.md`.
- **Ships that differ only in the default loadout group together** (owner rule "without
  loadout"). On LIVE `AEGS_Idris_P` groups under `AEGS_Idris_M` and `AEGS_Sabre_Comet` under
  `AEGS_Sabre`.
- **No name enters the rule, and playability does not either.** AI and mission variants follow
  the same rule as player ships.
- **The base** is the member with `playability` `player`, then the smallest `className`, then
  the smallest GUID.
- **Equality that cannot be shown leaves an entity ungrouped:** a ship without a definition or
  with an implementation that is not read in full, an item without a type or without a component
  that is compared.
  A value that could not be read also leaves an item ungrouped.
- **Equality is a 128-bit digest** of the compared data (SHA-256 cut to 16 bytes); nothing but the
  digest is kept per entity.

## Consequences

- A ship family whose members differ in the implementation splits into several
  groups; the Basetool may match them by the Modification and class name.
- Matching a pledge to a ship type needs a mapping of its own; it is not part of this decision.
- `variantOf` means "structurally identical", not "cosmetic" in the shop sense. On LIVE it also
  groups per-ship functional duplicates such as the `Controller_Shield_<ship>` and
  `Engineering_Buff_Modifier_<ship>` items, which are equal in every compared field and differ
  only in their name. Fitment such as ATC managers, docking tubes, intakes and quantum tanks may or
  may not split, depending on the Records (build 4.10 measured groups of 117, 75, 54 and 38 under
  an earlier version of the rule). They are kept grouped by decision; a consumer that wants only
  items players see or fit combines `variantOf` with `playability`.
- The item rule is conservative about components it does not know: an unknown cosmetic component
  keeps two otherwise equal items apart. The real-Archive test prints the groups and the near
  misses so that the lists can be refined.
