# Package materials are written as the game's raw inputs in format 1.1

Decided for issue #158 (M13.2); it extends ADR-0083 and uses the palettes of ADR-0080. The node
trees that #160 builds in Blender read what is decided here.

## Decision

**The package describes materials; it does not build them.** `scene.json` gets a `materials`
array of material descriptions, and `palettes`. A description holds what the game's `.mtl` file
holds for a material: shader, generation mask, surface type, flags, colours and scalars, texture
slots, layers and shader parameters. It holds no renderer concept: no Blender node, no
interpretation of what a shader does. The add-on, or any other importer, decides how to build
a surface from them. Where the writer derives a value (`alpha_mode`, a texture's `usage`, the
`palette` entry a material takes) the derivation is documented and the raw fields it comes from
stay next to it.

**Raw first, typed where a reader needs it.** The reader of the `.mtl` files in `p4kx-model` keeps
the layers (`MatLayers`, all attributes), the shader parameters (`PublicParams`), every other
attribute of the material, the attributes and child elements of each texture slot (`TexMod`
carries the UV tiling and offset) and every other child element, as name and text value in file
order. Elements are kept to a depth of 8 and a count of 4096 per material, layers to 64, as the
file is untrusted. Beyond a limit the reader cuts off and records it (`Material::truncated`, an
issue in the package); it never fails the file, so `entity glb` loses no material to it.
Descriptions are keyed by library path and index, with the model's folder for a bare library name. A parameter, attribute or element the writer has never heard of is therefore
in the package, unchanged: no list of known parameters has to be maintained for a new game
version. The few values importers always need as numbers (`TintColor`, `WearTint`, `UVTiling`,
`GlossMult` of a layer) are also written typed; a malformed one is absent, and the raw text stays.

**Layers are materials.** A layer's `Path` names a `.mtl` file, which is a material with its own
textures, parameters and layers. It is described like any other material and referenced by id,
so a layer file that ten hull materials use is written once. A layer file with a sub-material
list is entered by its `Submtl` name, else at its first entry; layers are followed to a depth of
8, and a file that names itself refers to its own description. A layer file that is missing or
unreadable is an issue (`origin` `material`, `kind` `layer_material`) and the layer has no
`material`.

**Descriptions and palettes are written once and referenced.** A description is identified by its
library path (normalised: `/`, no `Data/`, no `.mtl`, case folded) and sub-material index, a
palette by its value. Meshes reference the descriptions of the materials they are drawn with
(`materials[].material`) and their palette (`palette_id`). The description is the file's, with no
palette applied, so one description serves every livery; the mesh's palette says which colours
the `palette` entries take.

**All texture slots are written.** The `textures` of the package now hold every texture file a
described material names, not only the three glTF roles of 1.0: blend, mask, detail, wear and
occlusion maps are part of how the game layers a surface. They are named by id from the slot
(`textures[].texture`); engine placeholders (`$TintPaletteDecal`, `$RenderToTexture`) have no
file and no id. The colour space rule stays: `srgb` for diffuse maps, `linear` for the rest, and
normal maps are flipped to glTF. The package grows accordingly (the report of the PR gives sizes);
`--texture-mip` bounds it.

**Version 1.1, a minor version.** Everything added is an additional field or file; every 1.0 field
and meaning stays, including the `diffuse`/`normal`/`specular` ids of a mesh material. `materials`
and `palettes` are absent from the schema's required list, so a 1.0 manifest still validates and
reads. `Issue.origin` gains `material`. A reader of 1.0 that ignores the new fields still gets
what it got.

**Meshes carry the glTF material index.** Each material in a package mesh GLB gets `extras`
`{"p4kx_index": <index>}`, because Blender names and orders imported materials by first use. The
package writer adds it to the finished GLB; `entity glb` output does not change.

**Writing needs the Archive's material files.** `write_package` takes the `ModelProvider` that
built the Assembly, to read the layer files; the CLI passes the `ArchiveModels` it already has.

## Consequences

A package of a ship has one description per distinct material of its meshes plus one per
distinct layer file, and as many textures as those name. The add-on of #159 and #160 reads
`materials`, `palettes` and the new texture ids and may ignore everything else. New shader
parameters need no change of the writer, the schema or the add-on's reader: they arrive as
`parameters`. Interior and Character packages (#161, #162) reuse the same descriptions. The
decision which parameters mean what stays in the importer, where it can change without a new
package format.
