# The MCP audio excerpt is a bounded WAV and the only tool that returns audio

Decided for issue #287, on top of ADR-0038 (the legal notes of the MCP tools) and ADR-0018 (the
audio index).

## Decision

The MCP server answers questions about audio with metadata and paths: `search_audio_triggers`,
`get_entity_sounds`, `resolve_audio_trigger`, `list_soundbank_wems` and `get_wem_info` return
trigger and event names, IDs, soundbank and Entry paths, codec, channels, sample rate and
duration, and never a byte of audio.

`get_audio_excerpt` is the one exception, because the issue asks for it and a model cannot judge a
sound it cannot hear. It is bounded so that it stays an excerpt and not a way to move the sound
out of the Archive:

- at most 10 seconds (5 by default), and the WAV is cut where it would exceed 1 MiB; `truncated`
  is true whenever the excerpt is shorter than asked for, whether the 10-second limit, the size
  cap or the end of the sound cut it, and `max_bytes` states the cap;
- the audio is a 16-bit PCM WAV in an `audio/wav` content block next to the structured metadata;
  the structured content never holds audio bytes, so the output schema carries none;
- the decoder writes into a window that drops the frames before `start_seconds`, keeps the
  window and stops the decoder once it is full (when the header states the frame count), so a
  long sound gives a short excerpt and the WAV is never held whole; an excerpt that would reach
  beyond the first 64 MiB of decoded audio is refused;
- at most two audio reads run at once (the model permit);
- plug-in media and the prefetched start of a streamed sound cannot be decoded and are refused;
  a WEM ID with a loose Entry is read from the Entry, not from the prefetched start;
- the description says that the audio is game media and must not be redistributed, as every tool
  that returns Archive content does.

## Consequences

The audio index (every ATL definition and soundbank) is built once per open Archive and kept with
it, by the first audio call. `ArchiveAudio::with_index` lets a service user keep the index itself.
The calls that read a WEM or a soundbank (`list_soundbank_wems`, `get_wem_info`,
`get_audio_excerpt`) take a model permit inside the tool, after the audio index is built or
fetched, so a minutes-long index build never holds a permit. The trigger and Entity tools only
read the index and take none.

`get_wem_info` pages its `locations` with a cursor like the other lists and reports the language
folder of a WEM selected by `path`. A cursor beyond the listing is rejected as soon as the size
of the listing is known (the places of the WEM, the triggers of the Entity), before any WEM is
read or any item is built.

Memory per call, stated honestly: the source is read whole before it is parsed. A loose WEM up to
512 MiB (the cap of `Sound`), a soundbank up to 32 MiB (the cap of the audio index; a larger
Entry is refused by `list_soundbank_wems` and `get_wem_info`), plus the 1 MiB window and the
base64 text of the WAV, 1.4 MiB, which is more than the 256 KiB cap of the DataForge tools.
With two permits that is at most about 1 GiB for two loose WEMs of the largest size. Every
result is also held to the 256 KiB response cap, with the part around the items counted:
events are listed up to 25 per trigger, soundbanks up to 10 per event, broken links up to 25 and
issues up to 20, each with its total, and names are cut at 256 bytes, so no single item blocks
paging. `search_audio_triggers` reads the Record of every Entity on each call, so it looks up
Entities only when asked (`entities` above 0).
