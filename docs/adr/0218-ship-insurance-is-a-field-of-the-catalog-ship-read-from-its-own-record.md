# Ship insurance is a field of the catalog ship, read from its own Record

Decided for issue #323. Builds on ADR-0002, ADR-0054 and ADR-0065.

## Decision

- **The insurance data is the field `insurance` of every entry of `ships`,** not a kind of its
  own. The issue names a `ShipInsuranceRecord` with an `allShips` list; the Archive has no such
  type any more (LIVE). The data sits in the ship's own `EntityClassDefinition`, in the
  `SEntityInsuranceProperties` of its `StaticEntityClassData`, so the ship's `recordPath` is the
  source path and no second Record, link or ordering is needed.
- **The object holds the raw facts under their data names:** `restoreOnClaim`,
  `shipEntityClassName`, `baseWaitTimeMinutes`, `mandatoryWaitTimeMinutes` and `expediteFee` (the
  Record's `baseExpeditingFee`), each `null` when the Record states none. The object is `null`
  when the Record has no `SEntityInsuranceProperties`. What the names mean (claim time, shortest
  claim time, restore with the Loadout) is inferred from them; the Archive states no meaning.
- **`displayParams` stay out:** they repeat the ship's name, role, career, crew size and
  manufacturer, mostly as placeholders, and are game text.
- **No claim fee is exported.** The Records hold multipliers (`itemRecovery`) and one fee in
  aUEC per ship (`baseExpeditingFee`, exported as `expediteFee`), and the `EntityClassDefinition`
  Records of ships and items hold no field named like a price. A formula over the exported
  facts (the ship's fee, wait times and base data, and the multipliers) was tried against two
  in-game claim fees (#778); none reproduces both, so none is documented, and ADR-0065 forbids
  exporting a value that the data does not hold.
- **The recovery multipliers are the object `itemRecovery`,** not a kind: the
  `ItemRecoveryConfigurationParams` Record under `entitlementpolicies/`, its `economyParams`
  under their data names, with the override groups and the GUIDs of their entity classes. The
  Record is selected by a `KindRule` like the crafting global parameters, honours the Filter, and
  with several readable Records the smallest record path wins. A Record that cannot be read is
  left out and listed in the failures of the build, so `null` with a failure differs from
  `null` without one.
- **It is part of the unreleased `schemaVersion` 2,** with no bump.

## Consequences

- On LIVE all 1,066 catalog ships carry `insurance` with a fee.
- The Record is optional: an Archive without it gives `itemRecovery` `null`, and the choice
  follows ADR-0065, which exports what a Record states and nothing it does not.
