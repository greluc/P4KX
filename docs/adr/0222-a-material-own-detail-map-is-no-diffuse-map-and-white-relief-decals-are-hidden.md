# A material's own detail map is no diffuse map, and white relief decals are hidden

Decided for issue #757. It amends ADR-0212 (decals that draw no colour), ADR-0207 (the packed
detail map overlays through red only) and ADR-0100 (the add-on's surface mapping); ADR-0225 refines
the relief-decal rule. Evidence: the LIVE Archive, `AEGS_Hammerhead` and `AEGS_Gladius` as Blender
packages, compared against the owner's in-game screenshot of the Hammerhead.

## What the data says

- The `Metal_Flat_Light` material of the Hammerhead (`HardSurface`, `USE_DETAIL_MAPS`) names
  `aegs_ext_detail_01.tif` in `TexSlot1`. The file name ends in a number, so the suffix rule found
  no `_detail` and took the packed detail map for the diffuse map: its green and blue hold the
  detail normal, and multiplied into the grey hull they turned it purple.
- The `decal_pom` materials of the Hammerhead and the `pom`, `POM_Decal` and `detail_decals_pom`
  materials of the Gladius are `MeshDecal`s with `PARALLAX_OCCLUSION_MAPPING`, a displacement map
  (`_displ`), a white diffuse colour and `ETintModeType` 0. Their diffuse maps are white and grey
  (mean saturation below 0.01 on all of them: `aegs_exterior_pom_decal_diff`, `pom_decals_diff`,
  `line_decals_diff`, `crus_pom_diff`), the mask of the groove the displacement map cuts. Drawn as
  colour they paint white contour lines; in the game the panel lines are recesses.
- `Decal_POM` of the component master has the same white map but `ETintModeType` 6 and a tint map: a
  palette colours it, so it is not relief only. One `decal_pom` of the Hammerhead has a diffuse
  colour of 0.058: a colour of its own.
- The livery decal `Custom_decal` (`ship_showdown_decal.tif`) is in every Hammerhead material file:
  `aegs_hammerhead_exterior`, `_showdown`, `_camo_b` and `_fw2955_grey_black_red_camo` hold the same
  texture. The sub-geometries of the `Paint_Hammerhead_*` Paints swap only the tint palette and, for
  two of them, the material file. No palette carries a decal, no Paint a texture or a switch for
  this decal, and the hull number is not named in any Record we read.

## Decision

- **Texture suffix.** The suffix of a texture file name is its last `_` part that is not a plain
  number (`texture_suffix` in `p4kx-model`), so `aegs_ext_detail_01.tif` is `detail`. Both the GLB
  writer (no diffuse map) and the Blender package (`usage` `detail`, which the add-on overlays
  through red only, ADR-0207) use it.
- **Relief decals.** A material is a relief decal when it is a `MeshDecal` with
  `PARALLAX_OCCLUSION_MAPPING` in its generation mask and a displacement map, its diffuse colour is
  white (every channel from 0.99) and `ETintModeType` is 0 or missing (`Material::is_relief_decal`).
  It counts as a colourless decal, so `Material::hidden`, the GLB writer, the viewer and the add-on
  (`_relief_decal`) skip it. A decal with a colour of its own, a tint mode, no displacement map or
  no parallax mapping is drawn as before.
- **Livery decal and hull number.** Not decided: the data names no switch, so `Custom_decal` and the
  number stay drawn as the material file has them.

## Consequences

- The rule reads the material, not the pixels of the diffuse map, because the plan that hides a
  material runs before any texture is read. A white, untinted parallax decal whose map holds
  colour would be hidden too. None of the parallax decal maps of the two ships has colour.
- The relief itself (normal and displacement map) is not drawn, as for any colourless decal.
- A later change may find where the game chooses the livery decal, for example in a Record we have
  not read.
