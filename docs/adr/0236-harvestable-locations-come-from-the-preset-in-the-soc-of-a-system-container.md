# Harvestable locations come from the preset in the .soc of a system container

Decided for issue #320. Evidence: LIVE 4.10, ScDataDumper `SocpakMappingGenerator`.

## Decision

- The catalog exports the mining Records as five kinds of schema version 2 (`mineableCompositions`,
  `miningGlobalParams`, `harvestableProviderPresets`, `subHarvestableMultiConfigs`,
  `harvestableLocations`). Version 2 is not released, so no bump. Facts only: numbers, GUIDs and
  Record names; the one text is the `depositName` of a composition, a game text.
- A provider preset follows each harvestable to the entity and to the composition and mining
  parameters of its `MineableParams`, so a consumer reads which rocks a place can spawn without
  the `HarvestablePreset` Records, which are not a kind.
- A location is a container below `ObjectContainers/PU/system` whose first `.soc` holds the GUID of
  a kept provider preset after the string `preset`. The `.soc` is scanned as a stream, because a
  container holds a `.soc` of over 100 MB; the scan stops at 256 MiB and a container that hits
  the limit is warned about, never taken for one without a preset. The starmap object is the
  nearest one at or above the Child element that reaches the container in the walk of the system
  containers, a mining claim marker giving way to the object above it. A marker is a starmap
  object by its `description` key `@MiningClaims_Desc_001` (all 188 `PrivateMiningPoint_*`
  Records of LIVE 4.10 and no other), a field and not the class name. A container no Child
  reaches is listed with no object.
- A `HarvestablePreset` or entity Record that is missing or cannot be built is a warning with
  count and details; the link fields of its harvestables stay `null`.
- The catalog does not pin a container to an object by hand as ScDataDumper does for four
  containers, and it does not guess a place from a name: a preset no container names (the
  surface presets of the planets) has no location; its `objectPresetPaths` name the body.

## Amendment for issue #810

Evidence: LIVE 4.10, the `ReferenceIndex` of the DataForge, the entries of the Archive.

- The 30 presets without a location stay without one. No Record of the DataForge refers to a
  provider preset, the Archive holds no planet container (no `.socpak` or `.soc` of a planet or
  moon names a preset), and the `objectPresetPaths` name a body only in the folder
  `libs/objectpresets/pu/system/<system>/<body>/` of the Hurston presets; those of Pyro and of the
  other Stanton bodies sit in `libs/objectpresets/` with no body. The folder text equals a body
  only by its spelling (`ariel` for the moon Arial), so a mapping would be a guess from a name, as
  the decision above rules out. `HPP_Pyro_AkiroCluster` is named by a container no Child reaches
  and has a location with no object.
- Each container is still opened a second time for its `.soc`. On LIVE 4.10 the pass over 196,461
  containers takes 1.6 s of a 20.8 s build, and the walk reads the XML of a container, never the
  `.soc`; reading the `.soc` in the walk would couple the starmap walk to the harvest data for
  under 8 % of the build, so it is not done.
- A location with no object says why when a Child element reaches its container: the object is
  not in the catalog, the chain of objects above is longer than 64, or a mining claim marker has
  no object above it. The warning `harvest_locations_without_object` counts them with a line per
  reason; a container no Child reaches is the normal case and is not warned about.

## Consequences

- 19 of 49 presets of LIVE 4.10 have a location. A later Build that names more containers in a
  `.soc` raises the number without a change of the catalog.
