# Factions, reputation and mission data are facts, and lawful is a field

Decided for issue #319. Evidence: LIVE 4.10, ScDataDumper and NovaSCDataExtractor (facts only).

## Decision

- The catalog exports the Records that contracts refer to as seven kinds of schema version 2
  (`factionReputations`, `reputationScopes`, `reputationStandings`, `reputationContexts`,
  `missionTypes`, `missionLocalities`, `contractScenarios`). Version 2 is not released, so no bump.
  Each kind is the Records of one type under one folder, ordered by GUID.
- Facts only: GUIDs, Record names, numbers and links. The one kind of text is the name a Record
  shows in the game (faction, scope, standing, mission type), flagged `x-gameText` as the contract
  titles are. Descriptions, perk and journal texts, logos and icons stay out.
- A faction is lawful by the boolean `entityLawful` property of its `propertiesBB`, not by the
  `_Lawful_` in the class name that the other extractor uses. The field agrees with the
  `lawful_` or `unlawful_` prefix of all 24 factions of LIVE that have one and also classifies 14 of
  the 15 without (`Wikelo` lawful, `Ruto` not); a faction without the property (`IASI`) has `null`.
- A contract names its standing range by the `minStanding` and `maxStanding` of the contract
  (3,976 of 5,175 entries) and its reputation prerequisites per level (`handler`, `contract`,
  `subContract`) as stored. The catalog does not decide how the levels combine or what `exclude`
  inverts, because the Archive does not say.
- A locality has no localised name; its Record name is its name. A scenario keeps the tiers
  (points, badge identifier, multiplier, blueprint pools) and not the progression texts.
- Contract templates, mission broker entries, hauling orders, NPC and ship spawns and
  `MissionLocationTemplate` are not exported: the Basetool has no use for them yet and they are
  large, free-form structures. They can follow as further kinds.

## Consequences

- A consumer joins `contracts[].factionReputation`, `reputationGains[].scopeGuid`,
  `minStandingGuid` and `standingRequirements` to the new kinds by GUID, and
  `contracts[].missionTypeGuid` to `missionTypes`; on LIVE every link resolves.
- Two factions have enemies and none has allies on LIVE; the lists are as stored.
