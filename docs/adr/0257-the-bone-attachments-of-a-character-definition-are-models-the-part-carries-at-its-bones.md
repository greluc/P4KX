# The bone attachments of a character definition are models the part carries at its bones

Decided for issue #655. It completes the third section of ADR-0150, which drew the skin of a
character definition and left a second model per part undecided. Evidence: the LIVE Archive, the
main thruster of the M50 (`ORIG_M50_Main_Thruster_Nozzle.cdf`) and of the Gladiator.

## Decision

- **Reading.** An `Attachment` of type `CA_BONE` with a `BoneName` and a `Binding` is a bone
  attachment unless it is the drawn model. `RelPosition` (`x,y,z`, metres) and `RelRotation`
  (a quaternion `w,x,y,z`, `1,0,0,0` being none) default to no offset; a value that does not read as
  numbers, a rotation without length, a binding that is another definition and the 65th and further
  attachments are listed as left out. The numbers are read with the tolerant parser of ADR-0145.
- **Providing.** `ProvidedModel::attachments` holds one `ProvidedAttachment` per bone attachment
  that was read: its name, bone, offset, rotation, entry and model. A file that is missing or
  cannot be read is listed in `left_out`, so `attachments_left_out` names only what is not drawn.
- **Placing.** A bone attachment is not an Entity, so it is no part. A `Part` carries
  `attachments()`, each an `AttachedModel` with its own model and material library (the attachment's
  `Material` replaces the one the model names). Its transform to the part is the bind pose of the
  bone in the part's model, `bone_transform` as for the backpack and the item ports of a character
  definition, then the attachment's own offset. A bone the model lacks is `helper_not_found`, and
  the model sits at the part's origin with its offset.
- **Writing.** The GLB, the Blender package and the viewer scene write each attachment as a child
  of its part's node, after all parts and before the Interior, in the order of
  `Assembly::attached_models`; the indices of the parts are their own. A viewer piece has the path
  `<port path>/<name>`, so the tree lists it.
- **Limits.** The numbers of an attachment must be finite as `f32`, else it is left out. The
  models of one definition, skin and attachments together, are read up to
  `ArchiveModels::with_max_attachment_vertices` (by default `MAX_ASSEMBLY_VERTICES`); an
  attachment that passes it and the ones after it are left out.
- **Budget.** The vertices of the attachments count with those of the part's skin against the
  vertex budget, in the wave check and the part-by-part check, and against the bound of the model
  cache.

## Consequences

The thruster housings of the M50 and the Gladiator are drawn below their nozzle and are not in
`attachments_left_out`. The tint palette of the part applies to its
attachments. A landing gear's attachments are placed at the bind pose of its skeleton, as the
bone is looked up in the model the part draws.
