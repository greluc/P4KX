# The catalog verification measures texts per key and kind, not by a global share

Decided for issue #916. Evidence: LIVE 4.10. Builds on ADR-0054 (additive catalog) and ADR-0266
(location templates, #902).

## Decision

- The real-Archive verification no longer asserts a global share of German or English texts. A
  share over all kinds measures how complete the game's German `global.ini` is, so every new kind
  with untranslated keys can break it (the contract descriptions added 5,143 texts the German file
  lacks and took the share to 0.469 against 0.5).
- It checks the exporter per kind and key against the Archive's own `global.ini` files:
  - the expected text of a key is built in the test from the file's lines, not with the exporter's
    lookup: the key without its `@`, ASCII case ignored, a `key,P=` line standing for `key`, the
    first non-empty text, `\n` decoded and the text trimmed. The catalog's text must equal it; a key
    the file lacks or holds empty must be `null` (the Basetool falls back to English). A
    contradiction fails and names the kind, the keys and both texts. A contract text with a
    `~mission(…)` token is rewritten by the exporter, so only its presence is compared;
  - every `name` and every field marked `x-gameText` in the JSON Schema is measured wherever it
    sits in an entry, so a new text field is covered without a change of the test;
  - on LIVE the keys a file lacks are counted per kind and language and must stay within the
    baseline of that kind, measured on LIVE and rounded up to the hundredth. A kind that is not
    listed has a baseline of zero, so a new kind with untranslated keys names itself and its
    baseline is added on purpose. Other Channels check only the contradictions (ADR-0038: no
    test-channel numbers in committed tests).
- The numbers of every kind are printed, with the first keys the English file lacks.
- `missionLocationTemplates[].names[]` exports `displayName` as a game text (`x-gameText`) again,
  like every other named kind: #910 had reduced it to the `nameKey` to stay above the German floor.
  The catalog stays additive within schema version 2 (ADR-0054).

## Consequences

- Translation gaps in the game never fail the verification; a regression of the exporter, or a
  kind whose untranslated share grows past its baseline, does and names the kind.
- The English baseline of `missionLocationTemplates` is 0.09 because the English file itself lacks
  274 of the 3,211 keyed names on LIVE (samples: `@generic_locations_blank` and
  `@mission_location_pyro_0001`). The test confirms the key is absent from the file, so these are
  gaps in the game's data, not in the exporter. `@generic_locations_blank` also heads the English
  gaps of `contracts` and `starmapObjects`.
- A German baseline of 1.0 (`blueprints`, `refiningProcesses`) means no German text exists for the
  kind on LIVE, so only contradictions are checked there.
- The oracle covers the lookup rules above. It does not cover other transformations of the
  exporter; the only one in the catalog's texts is the `~mission(…)` rule.
- A change of the game that moves a share past its baseline is a deliberate edit of the baseline,
  made after looking at the kind.
