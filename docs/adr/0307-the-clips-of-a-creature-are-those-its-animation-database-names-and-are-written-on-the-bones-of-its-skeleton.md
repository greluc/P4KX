# The clips of a creature are those its animation database names and are written on the bones of its skeleton

Decided for issue #925, on top of ADR-0275 (the skins of a creature are written bound to the
skeleton of its root). Evidence: the LIVE Archive, `Kopion_CombatPet` and the census of every
Entity whose root geometry is a character file outside the human rigs.

## What the data says

An Entity Record names no clip. Its `SAnimatedCharacterComponentParams` name, in `animDatabase3P`,
a Mannequin animation database (`Animations/Mannequin/ADB/Creatures/Webhound/webhoundAnims.adb`;
the Kopion uses the Webhound's). The database is CryXml; each `Fragment` below its fragment lists
holds `Animation name="…"` elements, and `SubADB File="…"` elements nest further databases. The
name is the file name of a clip without extension (`ai_webhound_stand_alerted_idle_04` is
`ai/ai_webhound_stand_alerted_idle_04.caf`); blend spaces (`1d-bspace_…`) have no `.caf`.

The files lie where the parameter file of the skeleton, `kopion_skel.chrparams` beside
`kopion_skel.chr`, says: an `AnimationList` of `#filepath` folders (the Kopion's is
`Animations/Characters/Creatures/webhound`; a Vanduul's names its own folder first and one per
story chapter after it, so every `#filepath` counts, not the last) and, where there is one, a
`$TracksDatabase` `.dba`.

Census, creature Entities that write a skinned GLB (LIVE): 14 distinct databases. 724 rigged
Entities outside the human rigs name none (weapons, gadgets, ships). Per database the clips found
in the folders and the ones that fit the skeleton: Quasigrazer 75 / 67, Vlk 5 to 45 / 5 to 37,
Webhound 61 / 56, Yormandi 25 / 25, Vanduul 6 / 6, a powersuit 26 / 26. The Aloprat draws no skin,
so nothing is read. A player database (`playerAnims.adb`) names clips none of which is in the
folders of the skeleton it is paired with. The GLBs with clips are 8 to 44 MB.

## Decision

- **A creature gets the clips its animation database names.** `creature_animations` reads the
  database and the databases nested in it (at most 16, breadth first, each name once), finds the
  skeleton's parameter file (the skeleton file itself, or the one a character definition names),
  and reads the clips below all its `#filepath` folders and its `$TracksDatabase`. A name no clip
  has is skipped, so a blend space costs nothing but a second read of the folders. Nothing is read
  for an Entity that names no database or whose Assembly writes no skinned creature.
- **A clip is written on the bone nodes.** `Assembly::animate` fits the clips to the skeleton of
  ADR-0275: an additive clip, a clip with no track for a bone of the skeleton and a clip beyond
  the budget of `MAX_ANIMATION_VALUES` are left out and listed as `animation_not_used`, one
  Issue per reason. `Scene::with_animations` of `p4kx-gltf` writes the rest as glTF animations
  whose channels target the bone nodes, as the armour and model writers do; a scene without a
  skinned mesh has no bone nodes and writes none.
- **What cannot be found is a note.** A database, parameter file or folder the Archive lacks or
  cannot read is `animations_unavailable` on the root, `skipped` false, and the creature is
  written without clips.
- **`entity glb` writes the clips by default**, `--no-animations` leaves them out. The report's
  `animations` lists them as `model glb` does.
- **`entity package` stays static**, as in ADR-0275.

## Consequences

Facial and procedural animation (the `ProcLayer`, aim and look poses, which are additive) and
blend spaces are not written; rigid parts on a bone follow the bone only in a viewer that parents
them to it (#881). A clip named by a database of the human rigs is not read: the rule is the
creature rule of ADR-0275.
