# JSON output of `p4kx`

Every `p4kx` command takes `--json` (before or after the subcommand). With it, the command writes
exactly one line of compact JSON to stdout and nothing else; the exit codes stay the same. Errors
that end the command (an unreadable Archive, invalid input) are still printed to stderr as
`error: …` and produce no JSON. Warnings, such as an unreadable build manifest, go to stderr.

Paths of files on disk are strings as the operating system displays them. Entry paths are given
as stored in the Archive, with `\` as separator. Sizes are byte counts. Snapshots of every shape
live in [`crates/p4kx/tests/snapshots`](../crates/p4kx/tests/snapshots).

## Entry

The shape of one Entry in `list` and `search`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `path` | string | Entry path in the Archive |
| `compression` | string | `store`, `deflate`, `zstd`, or `method-<n>` for an unsupported ZIP method id |
| `encrypted` | bool | Whether the data is encrypted |
| `compressed_size` | number | Size of the data in the Archive |
| `size` | number | Size after decompression |

## Build

The shape of a Build in `info` and `channels`; `null` where the Build is unknown.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `branch` | string | e.g. `sc-alpha-4.11.0` |
| `version` | string | e.g. `4.11.42.1234` |
| `change_number` | string | The requested Perforce change number |
| `build_id` | string | The BuildId |

## `p4kx list <archive> --json`

```json
{"archive": "C:\\…\\LIVE\\Data.p4k", "entries": [Entry, …]}
```

Entries are in Archive order.

## `p4kx search <archive> <filter> --json`

```json
{"archive": "C:\\…\\LIVE\\Data.p4k", "filter": "*.xml", "entries": [Entry, …]}
```

`filter` is the Filter as given; `entries` holds the matching Entries in Archive order and is empty
when nothing matches.

## `p4kx info <archive> --json`

```json
{"archive": "…", "channel": "LIVE", "build": Build, "entry_count": 4, "encrypted_count": 1,
 "compressed_size": 35, "size": 118}
```

`channel` is the name of the folder holding the Archive, or `null` when there is none; `build` is
`null` when the Build is unknown.

## `p4kx channels --json`

```json
{"channels": [{"name": "LIVE", "build": Build, "source": "default", "archive": "…"}, …]}
```

`source` is `default` (below the default Library folder), `launcher` (below a Library folder from
the RSI Launcher log) or `manual`.

`p4kx channels add <path> --json` prints `{"action": "added", "kind": "folder", "path": "…"}`;
`action` is `added` or `already_added`, `kind` is `folder` or `archive`, and `path` is the
absolute path stored in the settings. `p4kx channels remove <path> --json` prints
`{"action": "removed", "path": "…"}`.

## `p4kx extract … --json`

```json
{"target": "…", "extracted": 1, "skipped": ["Data\\readme.txt"],
 "failed": [{"path": "Data\\broken.xml", "error": "cannot read the Entry data: …"}],
 "cancelled": ["Data\\large.bin"]}
```

`skipped` lists the Entries whose existing file in the target was kept under `--conflict`;
`failed` lists the Entries that were not written, with the reason and its causes joined by `: `;
`cancelled` lists the Entries not written because the run was cancelled. All three are in
Archive order. With `--json` failures are not repeated on stderr. The exit code is 1 when
`failed` or `cancelled` is not empty.
