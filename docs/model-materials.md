# Material libraries and plain-colour materials

What the reader of `p4kx-model` assumes about `.mtl` files, and how `p4kx-gltf` turns them into
plain colours. Surveyed on 2026-10-20 over all 26,083 `.mtl` Entries of LIVE. The tests are
`crates/p4kx-extraction/tests/real_archive_materials.rs` (`#[ignore]`d, run with `P4KX_DATA_P4K`;
both pass on LIVE and PTU) and the API tests of `p4kx-model` and `p4kx-gltf`.

## The file

A `.mtl` Entry is CryXml (the converted XML is 2 KB to 133 KB; the reader caps a file at
16 MiB). The root is `<Material>`. 19,126 files have a `<SubMaterials>` list (up to 116
sub-materials; the engine's limit is 128, the reader's 1,024), and 6,957 are one material that
serves every material ID. The material ID of a submesh is the position in the list. No file nests
a `SubMaterials` list in a sub-material or refers to another `.mtl` file by `File`, so there is no
sub-material cycle to follow; nested lists are not read, which also bounds the recursion.

Attributes per material: `Name`, `MtlFlags`, `Shader`, `StringGenMask`, `SurfaceType`, `Diffuse`,
`Specular`, `Emissive` (three comma-separated floats), `Opacity`, `Shininess` (0 to 255), `Glow`,
`AlphaTest`, and in the root `DefaultPalette`. A material may also have `Textures/Texture`
(`Map="TexSlot<n>"`, `File`), `PublicParams` and `MatLayers`; the reader keeps the texture slots
(placeholders such as `$TintPaletteDecal` and `$RenderToTexture` included, empty files left out)
and leaves the rest for textured materials (#105) and tints (#127).

- `MtlFlags` is a signed 32-bit number in the file (negative values occur); the reader keeps its
  32 bits. Bit `0x400` is the engine's no-draw flag: it is set on 24,626 materials, exactly the
  24,626 whose shader is `NoDraw` (one material each way differs). Bit `0x2` (two-sided) is set
  on 18,854 materials, mostly `HardSurface` and `Illum`.
- The colours are linear: `0.0097212186` is sRGB 0.1 linearised. glTF's factors are linear too,
  so they are written as they are.
- `Emissive` of `1,1,1` without `Glow` is common on `Illum` (8,243 of 13,625 materials with a
  non-zero emissive colour have no `Glow`), so the emissive colour counts only times `Glow`.
- Missing attributes read as white diffuse, a dim dielectric specular (0.04), no emission,
  opacity 1 and shininess 10. Malformed or non-finite numbers read like missing ones.

## Finding the library

The `MtlName` chunk names the library. The name is

- a path below `Data` without extension (`Objects/Spaceships/Ships/AEGS/Gladius/AEGS_Gladius`),
  the common case, resolved ignoring case and the kind of separator;
- a bare name (`f_facial_hair_021`), which the engine takes relative to the model: it is looked
  for as `<name>.mtl` beside the model first, then below `Data`;
- rarely with a `Data/` prefix and `.mtl` extension (`Data/Objects/.../m_qrt_combat_..._01.mtl`),
  which are stripped.

Of 150 sampled `.skin` files per Archive, 104 find their library; character skins often name a
library that lives in another folder and is chosen by the item's Entity, not by the skin (for
example `m_cds_legacy_medium_helmet_01_01_hd_sec`). Of the static models with a library name,
66 of 69 (LIVE) and 65 of 67 (PTU) find it; the rest name libraries the Archive does not hold
(`Objects_default_grid_blue`, `kbar_s1-3_bas_1`). A library that is missing is a status of the
model, not an error: the model reads and exports with the default material.

A name is checked before any file is asked for: an empty, absolute or drive-qualified path, or one
with an empty, `.` or `..` component, is `Unreadable` and never reaches the resolver. The Archive
resolver only looks the path up in its index; the disk resolver reads `<last component>.mtl`
beside the model.

## Plain colours in glTF

| glTF | from |
| --- | --- |
| base colour | `Diffuse`; for metals `Specular` |
| alpha | `Opacity`; 1 with `AlphaTest` (masked); at most 0.3 for `GlassPBR` |
| alpha mode | `MASK` with cutoff `AlphaTest` when above 0; `BLEND` for `GlassPBR`, the decal shaders `MeshDecal` and `Decal`, and `Opacity` below 1; else `OPAQUE` |
| double sided | `MtlFlags` two-sided, and the decal shaders |
| metallic | 1 when `Specular` is bright (luminance at least 0.5) and the `SurfaceType` starts with `metal` or `Diffuse` is dark (luminance under 0.2); else 0 |
| roughness | 1 − `Shininess` / 255; 0.5 for `HardSurface`, `LayerBlend_V2` and `Layer`, whose gloss comes from textures and layers |
| emissive | `Emissive` times `Glow`, divided by its brightest channel when that exceeds 1 |

These are heuristics for a file without textures, after the findings of the StarBreaker review
(#104). A material that draws nothing (the no-draw flag, the `NoDraw` shader or opacity 0) gets no
glTF material and its submeshes are not written; the summary counts them as hidden. A material ID
beyond the sub-materials, or any ID when the library is missing, gets one shared default material
(light grey, matt); the engine draws such IDs with `material_default.mtl`, which the reader does
not load.

`HardSurface` and `LayerBlend_V2` (23,770 and 46,806 materials) take their colour from `MatLayers`
and the tint palette, so their plain colour is the white `Diffuse`; tints are #127.

## Textured materials

Surveyed on 2026-10-20 over LIVE: 36,786 distinct texture files in the `.mtl` files, none of them
encrypted (like the models, the `.mtl` files and every `.dds` Entry), so no Archive key is needed
to read them. The tests are `crates/p4kx-extraction/tests/real_archive_textured_materials.rs`
(`#[ignore]`d) and the API tests of `p4kx-gltf` and the CLI tests `model_textures.rs`.

### Which file is which

A texture's `File` is a source image (`Objects/…/plate_diff.tif`); the Archive holds the `.dds`
of that name, split into parts and with an alpha tail. The loader is given `Objects/…/plate_diff.dds` below `Data`, found ignoring case and the kind of
separator through the path index. A path that is empty, absolute, drive-qualified or has an empty,
`.` or `..` component, or a control character, never reaches the loader and is listed; the engine
placeholders (`$RenderToTexture`, `$TintPaletteDecal`) are no files and are skipped silently.

The slot says little by itself (`TexSlot1` is the diffuse map of `Illum`, `HardSurface`, `Layer`,
`MeshDecal` and `Decal`, but the blend mask of `Organic`; `TexSlot2` and `TexSlot3` hold the
normal map of the shader families that use layers), so the role comes from the slot and the last
`_` part of the file name together:

| role | slot | name ends in | LIVE (largest classes) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| diffuse | `TexSlot1` | anything but `ao`, `blend`, `mask`, `opac`, `id`, `scalp`, `dir`, `dirm`, `hal`, `wear`, `displ`, `disp`, `detail`, `gloss`, `ddna`, `ddn` | `_diff` 49,803 `Illum`, 4,073 `HardSurface`, 3,764 `MeshDecal` |
| normal | `TexSlot2`, else `TexSlot3` | `_ddna` (smoothness in the alpha tail) or `_ddn` | 39,267 + 16,021 `Illum`, 17,626 + 13,907 `LayerBlend_V2` |
| specular | `TexSlot4` | `_spec` | 18,499 `Illum`, 997 `LayerBlend_V2` |

Everything else is not read: the second layer (`TexSlot9` `_diff`, `TexSlot12` `_blend`,
`TexSlot11` `_wear`, `TexSlot13` `_hal`), detail maps (`TexSlot6`), displacement (`TexSlot8`) and
the layers and tint palettes of `HardSurface` and `LayerBlend_V2`. They belong to layered
materials and tints (#127); a `LayerBlend_V2` material gets only what its first slots hold. The
UV tiling of `MatLayers` is not applied (`KHR_texture_transform` is not written).

### How the textures look

Of 5,255 sampled files (every seventh), 192 are not in the Archive under the `.dds` name. The
formats: normal maps `BC5_SNORM` with a `BC4_UNORM` alpha tail (the smoothness, 1,047 of 1,066
sampled `_ddna`; the others have no tail and give no roughness), diffuse maps `BC1_UNORM`, `BC3_UNORM` or `BC7_UNORM_SRGB`,
specular maps `BC1_UNORM`. The `UNORM` ones are not flagged as sRGB although they are authored as
sRGB, so every diffuse and specular byte is taken as sRGB, as glTF wants a base colour texture. A
cubemap, array or volume is no surface texture and is listed as unreadable.

### Mapping to glTF

| glTF | made of |
| --- | --- |
| base colour texture | the diffuse map; alpha only for `MASK` and `BLEND` materials, else opaque (an opaque material ignores the alpha channel, and an opaque image compresses better) |
| normal texture | the `_ddna`/`_ddn` map: X and the reconstructed Z (BC5 stores X and Y only, Z is `√(1−x²−y²)`) as decoded, **green inverted**, opaque |
| metallic-roughness texture | green = roughness = 1 − smoothness (the alpha tail of a `_ddna`), blue = metalness from the specular map, red full |
| factors | with a metallic-roughness texture that carries the channel 1, else the plain value of the table above; with a diffuse map the `Diffuse` colour is the base colour factor |

*Roughness.* The smoothness is a linear 0 to 1 value, the same scale as the plain `Shininess`
(1 − `Shininess` / 255), so the image and the factor agree. StarBreaker maps the texture with
`√(1−s)`; no evidence in the files favours that, so the linear inverse is used for both. A
material's own `Shininess` does not multiply the texture (it varies from 0 to 255 over materials
with a normal map, without a pattern that would say it is a multiplier).

*Metalness.* There is no metalness map in the engine. The specular map and `Specular` colour give
it: a texel is metal in proportion to the linear luminance of its tinted specular colour, from
0.15 (a dielectric's reflectance, at most) to 0.5 (a metal's, at least). The base colour of a
metal is its specular colour and its diffuse colour is dark (`Diffuse` 0, `Specular` 1 is common:
the `chipped_paint` and `Metal_*` materials of the Gladius), so with a specular map the image
holds `Diffuse` times the diffuse map moved towards `Specular` times the specular map by the
texel's metalness, in linear light, and the base colour factor is white. The key of that image
holds both colours, so materials that differ only in them do not share it. A diffuse map without
a specular map is a dielectric: the `Diffuse` colour stays a factor, shares the image, and the
metal heuristic of the plain colours does not apply. A specular map is only used with a diffuse
map to blend with. Different sizes are sampled to the larger (nearest texel).

*Alpha.* A masked material uses the alpha channel of its diffuse map with the cutoff
`AlphaTest`, which closes the open note of #104 that `MASK` needs the texture alpha; the factor
stays 1. A `GlassPBR` material keeps the alpha factor of at most 0.3 and blends, times the alpha of
its diffuse map; its glass layers and dirt maps are layered materials (#127).

### Green channel of the normal map

glTF's normal textures point green up the image (+Y, OpenGL), and viewers that do not take the
`TANGENT` attribute derive a bitangent that points up the image. The engine's point down. Two
independent measurements on LIVE:

- The stored tangent frame (docs/model-lods-and-vertex-attributes.md): over 600 sampled models
  (4.06 million triangles) `cross(normal, tangent) * w` points along +V, down the image, in
  99.2 % of the triangles, and the tangent along +U in 99.7 %.
- The curl of the normal maps: a normal map of a height field `h` has `(−∂h/∂x, ±∂h/∂y)`, so the
  change of its red channel down the rows and the change of its green channel along the columns
  are opposite when green points up and agree when it points down, whatever the height. Of
  2,905 sampled `_ddna` and `_ddn` maps, 1,450 with a clear correlation (above 0.2 in magnitude)
  agree in 1,337 cases (92 %): green points down. Per use in a shader family (a second sample of
  every second map): `Illum` slot 2 `_ddna` 92 % (6,397 of 6,928), `LayerBlend_V2` slot 3 `_ddn`
  and `_ddna` 94 % and 98 %, `MeshDecal` 99.8 %. The measurement was checked on synthetic
  height fields of both conventions. A minority of `_ddn` maps of `Hair` (82 % up) and `GlassPBR`
  (71 % up) and a few grilles (`rsi_bengal_grating`, `anvl_rubber_padding`) have green up; they
  stay as the engine has them, and render inverted in the engine too if they are authored wrong.

So the writer flips the green channel of every normal map (`G' = 255 − G`) and negates the
handedness `w` of the tangents, which makes the frame `(T, cross(N, T) * w')` point up the image
as glTF's does; a viewer that uses the `TANGENT` attribute and one that derives its own agree.
`TANGENT.w` is written for every export, with or without textures.

### Images in the file

The PNGs are embedded in the binary chunk of the GLB, one buffer view per image, so the file is
one piece; writing them next to it would break a GLB moved on its own. An image is identified by
what it is made of (its source files, with the colours that go into it): materials that share it
share it in the file, and the summary counts it once. The most common sharing is the normal map
across the materials of one ship. At most 256 images and 2^29 pixels (a 4k texture is 2^24) are
embedded; the images beyond are listed as over budget and their materials keep their colours. A
single texture of more than 2^26 pixels is refused. They are decoded a few at a time and encoded
in parallel. `--texture-mip n` selects mip `n`, 0 the largest; a texture with fewer mips gives its
last. The Gladius interior (17 images) takes 6.1 s and 19.2 MB at mip 0 and 0.64 s and 4.4 MB at
mip 2.

Not examined: emissive and occlusion maps (`TexSlot9` `_diff` of `Illum` with `%BLENDLAYER` is the
second layer, not emission), the PBR extensions for glass (#127) and `KHR_texture_transform`.
